# VA-part-time-pay
Figure out how much I get paid in a two week period after taxes. I was tired of trying to estimate how much I was going to pay in taxes each paycheck so I made myself a caluculator that can be accessed through the command line.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used** Python, Visual Studio Code
I made a simple python application that takes user input to gather the information needed to calculate the taxes. I used to loops to gets accurate information from the user. For example, I ask if the user already knows their gross income this paycheck. They can answer Y/y or N/n with spaces anywhere for it to be valid, but if an answer isn't found, the application loop asks the question again until the answer is valid. The time complexity of this application is O(n) because of the user input loops.

## Known Issues:
This application does not calculate federal income tax.

## Instructions to build:
Make sure your have Python3 downloaded on your computer. 

## Instructions to run:
Download the file. Open your command line and open the folder that the file is saved in. Use the command 'python calculator.py' to run the program. To exit the program early, do Ctrl+C
